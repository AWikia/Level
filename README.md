### Supplementary Private Use Area-A (F0000 - FFFFD)
This unicode block includes various advanced glyphs, including Component ones

#### Component Glyphs (F0000 - F0FFF)
Unicode range F000-F0FFF is allocated for all Component Glyphs. Those glyphs are used for properly constructing the COLR font, but they can be used as stationary characters if needed by the user. 95 are supported currently

#### Supplementary Letter Style Glyphs (F1000 - F1FFF)
Unicode range F1000-F1FFF is allocated for all Supplementary Letter Style Glyphs and all glyphs. 240 are supported currently and are exclusive to the BW font unless its name is bolded in where it will exist in COLR font as well, with 22 being available in both fonts. All holes in each subrange indicate that a character can be found at a standarized unicode block like Letterlike Symbols. It is also allocated for glyphs constructed with combining characters, including the enclosing keycap glyphs

| No.  | Glyphs  | Unicode Range | Name                       |

| 0011 | 0010    | F10EA-F10F3   | **Numbers: Old Style**     |
| 0012 | 0001    | F10F4         | **Slashed Zero**           |


Once glyphs from this range come to Unicode, those will be removed entirely from the original spot to encourage using the standarized equivalents, with the original spots being permanently unallocated so users can know that it had those glyphs previously. This does not apply to composition glyphs as those will permanently reside here (Like the Keycap Number glyphs)

#### Emoji Skin Tones (F2000 - F6FFF)
Unicode range F2000-F6FFF is allocated for all skinned emoji. 51 are supported currently in each subrange, supporting 255 total glyphs. Those with bolded names are ZWJ glyphs in addition. Includes the following glyphs in both BW and COLR fonts (Where **x** is a hexadecimal number between 2 to 6):
